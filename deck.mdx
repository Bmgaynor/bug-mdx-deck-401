# Demonstarting static assets bug.

[Issue 401](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck/issues/401)

---

You can not include an image by specifying the path to the static asset.

```
<img src="images/tree.jpg" />
```

<img src="images/tree.jpg" />

---

Also does not work with Markdown images.

```
![tree](images/tree.jpg)
```

![tree](images/tree.jpg)

---

import Tree from "./static/images/tree.jpg";

Works when using imports.

```
import Tree from "./static/images/tree.jpg";

<img src={Tree} />
```

<img src={Tree} />
